# Voting on Disputes
This document covers how to vote on disputes.

# About Voting
TRB holders vote on the validity of the data and if the miner is found to be _malicious_ their stake goes to the party that initiated the dispute, otherwise the dispute fee goes to the miner.

# Prerequsites
* You will need Metamask browser wallet or a similar web-based wallet to connect.
* You must be holding the TRB you will use to vote _prior_ to the dispute being created. This prevents someone from just buying TRB to over turn a dispute after being disputed.
* TRB you use to vote with is _not_ at risk of being lost due to the outcome of the vote.
